## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madou/armory-react.git
cd armory-react
yarn // or npm install
cp src/config/local.sample.js src/config/local.js // You need to create a local config yourself!
```

### Testing

```bash
npm run tdd // UNIT TESTS + WATCHER
npm test // FULL TEST (lint/flow/coverage+unit)
```

### Website

```bash
npm run dev // DEV BUILD
npm run start // PROD BUILD
```

### Embeds

```bash
npm run dev:embeds // DEV BUILD
npm run start:embeds // PROD BUILD
```

### Technologies

- React (view engine)
- Redux (data container)
- Flow (static type checking)
- Webpack (asset bundler)
- LESS (css preprocessor)
- Mocha/enzyme/chai/sinon (testing)
- nyc/Coveralls (code coverage)

## Notes for Local Development

- If running locally make sure you add a `local.js` to the `src/env/` folder. Look at `local.sample.js` for help. This isn't checked in deliberately so we can play with local settings without affecting git history.
- If needed you can get the api over at [armory-back](https://github.com/madou/armory-back). You will have to update your `config/local.js` to point to `localhost` if running the api locally.
- We use `pre-commit` to run commands before checking in. This will run `npm test` which covers linting, flow errors, and tests.

## Deployments

Deployments are triggered to `preview.gw2armory.com` via any branch commit, and to `gw2armory.com` via any tagged commit to `master` branch. Note that `master` doesn't reflect what is in production - look for the most recent tagged commit for that.

We use `np`.

```bash
np major|minor|patch
```

This will increment the version, update CHANGELOG.md (anything under Unreleased will be moved to a version), and push to git.

### Redux Dev Tools

Enabled in dev mode only, [go install the extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/) and then open it while running the armory locally.
