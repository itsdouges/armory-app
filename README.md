## Quick Start

```
git clone https://github.com/madou/armory-react.git
cd armory-react
npm i
cp src/config/local.sample.js src/config/local.js
npm run dev
```

## Notes for Local Development

- If running locally make sure you add a `local.js` to the `src/env/` folder. Look at `local.sample.js` for help. This isn't checked in deliberately so we can play with local settings without affecting git history.
- If needed you can get the api over at [armory-back](https://github.com/madou/armory-back). You will have to update your `config/local.js` to point to `localhost` if running the api locally.
